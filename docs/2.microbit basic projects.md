![2top](img/2top.png)

The LED dot matrix consists of 25 LEDs arranged in a 5 by 5 square, corresponding to axis-X and Y. In order to locate these LEDs quickly, we can regarded this matrix as a coordinate system by marking 0~4 from top to bottom and from left to right.

Therefore, the LED sat in the second of the first line is (1,0) and the LED positioned in the first of the third row is (2,0), the fifth of the first column is (0,4), the second of the third column is (2,1), and others likewise.

![j601](img/j601.png)

#### Introduction

![3top](img/3top.png)

In this project, we introduce the geomagnetic sensor (magnetometer) on the micro:bit board, which can not only detect the geomagnetic field strength, but also be used as a compass to determine the direction.

The main component of a common compass is a magnetic needle, which can be turned and pointed to the **geomagnetic North Pole** under the force of the geomagnetic field to identify the direction.

**The built-in geomagnetic sensor (magnetometer/compass) reads the geomagnetic field data to obtain <span style="color: rgb(0, 191, 191);">Azimuth Angle relative to the north magnetic pole</span>, so as to convert the result to between 0 and 359 degrees for orientation.**

### Project 7: Accelerometer

![j701](img/j701.png)

#### Introduction

![3top](img/3top.png)

The micro:bit board boasts a built-in LSM303AGR acceleration sensor (accelerometer) which includes standard, fast, plus and high-speed mode (100 kHz, 400 kHz, 1 MHz and 3.4 MHz) of I2C serial bus interface and SPI serial standard interface for external communication, with resolution of 8/10/12 bits and range of ±2g, ±4g, or ±8g.

When the micro:bit board is at rest or in uniform motion, the accelerometer only detects the acceleration of gravity. If the board is slightly swung, the detected acceleration is much less than the that of gravity, but the difference can be ignored. Therefore, we mainly detect the change of gravitational acceleration on the x, y, and z axes.

In this project, we will introduce how to measure the position of the board with the accelerometer. And then we may have a look at the original three-axis value output by the accelerometer.

### Project 8: Light Brightness Detection

![j101](img/j101.png)



#### Introduction

![3top](img/3top.png)

In this experiment, we will use the micro:bit board to detect light intensity. Since the micro:bit board does not contains its own photoresistor, the LED dot matrix will shoulder this job. The light signal will convert into input, and the voltage decay time is sampled so that the detected light intensity is a relative value. (Note: Output the light brightness level to the serial port, and the output is a relative value.)

| Micro USB cable*1     | ![usb](img/usb.png)               |



#### Connection

Connect the board to your computer via micro USB cable.

![microbit&usb](img/microbit&usb.png)



#### Test Code

Find code blocks:

① write **Name: value** and a line-break(\r\n) on the serial monitor in pair.

![j502](img/j502.png)

It is common to use Name value pairs when reporting or recording data. They are displayed together as a text output string in the form of Name and value. The Name and value are separated in the string by a colon”:”. A Name value pair that reports a temperature of -15 degrees looks like:

Temperature: -15



② set the USB used to serial input and output.

![j503](img/j503.png)



③ ambient temperature. Temperature is measured in degrees Celsius (metric). The micro:bit can find ambient temperatures by the temperature of its computer chip. 

![j504](img/j504.png)



④ run code according to whether the Boolean condition is true or false. If you want to run other code when the opposite condition is true, you can put them in “else”.

⑤ comparison operator, comparing the left and right value, and the comparison is Boolean true or false.

![j801](img/j801.png)



⑥ show an icon on the LED matrix.
